## ðŸ§© Technologies Used

### 1. **Programming Language**

* **Python 3.x** â€“ The main programming language used for building, training, and evaluating the deep learning model.

---

### 2. **Deep Learning Framework**

* **PyTorch** â€“ Framework used to implement and train the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
* **torchvision** â€“ Provides pretrained models (e.g., ResNet50), transformation utilities, and dataset handling support.

---

### 3. **Data Processing & Evaluation**

* **Pandas** â€“ Used for data manipulation and management of dataset metadata.
* **scikit-learn (sklearn)** â€“ Used for data splitting (`train_test_split`) and performance evaluation (`classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`).

---

### 4. **Image Handling**

* **Pillow (PIL)** â€“ Used for loading and processing image data.
* *(Optional)* **OpenCV** â€“ Can be integrated for real-time face detection or preprocessing.

---

### 5. **Visualization**

* **Matplotlib** â€“ Used to visualize model performance such as accuracy/loss graphs and confusion matrices.

---

### 6. **Deep Learning Components**

* **torch.nn** â€“ Contains neural network building blocks such as layers and activation functions.
* **torch.optim** â€“ Provides optimization algorithms like SGD and Adam.
* **torch.utils.data (Dataset & DataLoader)** â€“ Manages image datasets efficiently for training and validation.

---

### 7. **Utilities**

* **time** â€“ Used to measure training duration and performance.
* **os** â€“ Handles directory and file operations.
